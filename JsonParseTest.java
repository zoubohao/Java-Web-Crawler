In other words, if the government or the IMF says we do not need profits, then today&rsquo;s electricity prices can be reduced by 5 percent and the CEB made fully viable,&rdquo; he said.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nHe noted that currently, the Sri Lankan consumers are not aware of the hidden costs of the CEB due to its inefficiencies in supply and administration, including overcompensation and overstaffing, which are covered through subsidies by large-scale industrial and commercial clients and government guarantees.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n&ldquo;So the government subsidizes, sooner or later. They let the subsidies promised to accumulate for several years, shown as accumulated losses of the CEB and then make a huge noise that the CEB is making losses, then off-load the debts,&rdquo; Dr. Siyambalapitiya added.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nHe said that the debt burden is then borne by the consumers through taxes. Given Sri Lanka&rsquo;s tax structure, which is largely indirect, all sections of society have to contribute towards this.<br \\/>\\n&ldquo;Only by pricing electricity at what it costs and being full transparent about any targeted subsidies, can the CEB inefficiencies and the government&rsquo;s undue interference be highlighted&rdquo; Dr. Siyambalapitiya said.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nA better informed society could put pressure on the government and the CEB to become the leaner and meaner in its management, following the implementation of the formula, which will provide a breakdown of costs, according to Dr. Siyambalapitiya.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n&ldquo;When a customer takes a bill, he can now compare and ask, &lsquo;Why has the generation energy cost gone up? Why has the distribution cost gone up?&rsquo; and demand answers,&rdquo; he said.<br \\/>\\nSri Lanka&rsquo;s electricity costs are considered one of the many reasons for the lack of both local and foreign investment into foreign exchange earnings industries.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nA large-scale commercial venture in Sri Lanka would be charged Rs.23.65 per unit, while in competing foreign direct investment destinations such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, the price is Rs.14.01 and Rs.14.46, respectively, according to RMA Energy Consultants data.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nA very large industrial unit will be charged Rs.15.19 per unit in Sri Lanka, while getting charged Rs.9.42 in Vietnam and Rs.14.46 in Bangladesh.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nFurther, such operations in Sri Lanka have to subsidize small and medium-scale power-consuming households, which make up a significant portion of the country&rsquo;s electricity demand.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe formula was initially supposed to be implemented in December 2016, although this March, the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had said that a formula, which had been developed, was not satisfactory and that a new one was being prepared.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe IMF, when approving the delayed tranche of balance of payments support this week, reminded the government to implement cost-reflective formulae for energy supply.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nAt a recent public consultation on the government&rsquo;s power generation plans, experts said that country&rsquo;s power grid is fragile due to with numerous weather-related supply-side disruptions and the lack of redundancy, which forces the government to choose costlier generation options, putting a greater burden on the people.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\",\"ADDED_DATE\":\"2017-07-19 20:18:06\",\"PUBLISH_DATE\":\"2017-07-20 00:01:49\",\"PUBLISH_END_DATE\":null,\"EVENT_DATE\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT1\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT2\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT3\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT4\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT5\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT6\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT7\":\"\",\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT8\":\"\",\"EXTERNAL_URL\":null,\"HITS\":\"1101\",\"COMMENTS\":\"0\",\"AUTHOR\":\"134\",\"AUTHOR_NAME\":\"Dineth Rathnayaka\",\"COMMENT_STATUS\":\"1\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"SPECIAL\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_LIST\":\"Business News\",\"REGION\":null,\"REGION_NAME\":null,\"KEYWORDS_LIST\":null,\"METATAG_LIST\":null,\"RELATED_LIST\":null,\"SCORE\":\"0.7988201975822449\",\"URL_CATEGORY\":[{\"CATEGORY_ID\":\"273\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"EDITION_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"Business News\",\"ALIAS\":\"business-news\",\"ARTICLE_COUNT\":\"13920\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"PARENT\":\"215\",\"LEAF\":\"1\",\"DEFAULT_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"SPECIAL_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"HIDDEN_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_REGION\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR_ORDER\":\"0\"}],\"IMAGES\":[{\"ARTICLE_FIELD_ID\":\"86089\",\"FIELD_ID\":\"19\",\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"133120\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"FIELD_TITLE\":\"Category Image\",\"FIELD_TYPE\":\"THUMB\",\"FIELD_VALUE\":\"media\\/images\\/image_1500475667-71c67d6d99.jpg\",\"STATUS\":\"1\"}]},{\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"136448\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"Military in North should not be removed: Gammanpila\",\"SUBTITLE\":\"\",\"ALIAS\":\"Military-in-North-should-not-be-removed-Gammanpila\",\"INTRO_TEXT\":\"Responding to a statement made by Northern Province Chief Minister C.

Since then, many have queried whether textbooks are needed in a digital world, given that extensive and often free online resources are now available.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe digital era has challenged conventional practices on textbooks. Should physical textbooks be replaced by packaged digital materials? With free online resources, should governments stop allocating budgets to textbooks? Are schools in developing countries using digital sources to improve learning?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe answers to these questions are not binary but depend on the development context of countries including their digital infrastructure availability, affordability and capacity. Even as developing countries catch up on the digital curve, the good old physical textbook cannot be debunked.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \\/>\\nDigital learning materials are indispensable in the modern era. But it&rsquo;s just as important that they be supported by next-generation physical textbooks that guide and amplify their impact.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n<strong>Five ways&nbsp;<\\/strong><br \\/>\\nHere are five ways in which policymakers can deliver textbooks that work with digital learning to boost student performance in developing countries.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n1 Make textbooks more &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; to help navigate the curriculum.<br \\/>\\nTextbooks are still crucial to the education process and provide a roadmap for grade and subject-specific learning attainments. A 2016 study by the Harvard Education Policy Research Centre found high achievement gains for students using top-quality textbooks.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe policy paper &lsquo;Why Textbooks Count by Cambridge Assessment&rsquo; was influential in bringing attention back to textbooks in England by finding that England&rsquo;s poor performance in math compared to star performers like Finland and Singapore can be attributed to the fact that only 10 percent of teachers in England used textbooks.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nHowever, the pace of change calls for developing countries to ensure that textbooks are dynamic and updated faster to reflect guiding principles on knowledge and skills that are important for the future.<br \\/>\\n2 Blending digital resources with physical textbooks for the millennials.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nEven advanced nations such as the Republic of Korea (which had an explicit target to go fully digital in textbooks by 2015) or the United States (where states like California and Texas favour digital books) have not yet gone fully digital.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nBut developing countries, even though faced with challenges on basics like teachers, classrooms and toilets, can and should blend videos, simulations and multimedia materials with textbooks to meet the learning needs of the current generation students.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe real power of digital resources lies in transforming how students are taught to make learning more suited to millennials in being interactive, personalized and self-directed.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n3 Reposition the role of the teacher to go beyond textbooks.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe digital era has brought in diverse learning materials and tools. The teacher&rsquo;s role today is to be a coach rather than simply a purveyor of knowledge. Next-generation textbooks promoting independent and project-based study demand teachers who are more proactive and creative.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThis is happening in Nepal, where the Asian Development bank (ADB) is helping the Curriculum Development Centre develop online materials for teaching science, math and English in middle school so that teachers become adept in using e-content. In the a2i programme in Bangladesh, teachers form an online community to create and share learning materials in the teachers&rsquo; portal.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nIn Bhutan and Sri Lanka, ADB helped to pilot the &lsquo;Math Cloud&rsquo; programme, an adaptive learning tool which tailors the learning pathways to the specific level of each student. Teachers use the tool to help students at different stages of learning to master concepts through independent study.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n4 Invest jointly in next-generation textbooks and digital materials.<br \\/>\\nSome believe that with free online resources, governments can do away with textbooks and save money. The reality is quite the contrary. To upgrade static and old-fashioned textbooks, governments need to invest substantially in developing newer models of textbooks that are reliable and efficient navigating tools in a digital world and which can also be paired with their digital twins.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe developing world faces many paradoxes &ndash; it is not uncommon to find a well-resourced school with smart classrooms and digital resources in an urban setting and travelling two hours away, see a rural school without proper classrooms, electricity and teachers. Budget allocations from government need to cater to the different realities.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nContinued need for high-quality textbooks and digital learning tools and systems call for more rather than less investment by governments.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n5 Improve school connectivity for multiple sources of online learning.<br \\/>\\nComputers began to permeate the school during the ICT era. But now the game-changer is connectivity. In Nepal, which is implementing a US $ 6.4 billion School Sector Development Plan (in partnership with ADB and other development partners), only 4,000 of about 32,000 schools have connectivity.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nBetter connectivity is a must. It opens the way for e-libraries and e-learning platforms to be established to supplement textbooks and update schools on the latest educational trends and innovative teaching methods.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe role of textbooks is even more relevant in the digital world.&nbsp; They can provide an underlying blueprint to help navigate the vast jungle of open resources and online materials to attain specific learning goals.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nBut we must innovate and reposition textbook policy and practice for the global digital era. Only then can digital resources and technology tools be integrated with textbook content to improve student learning.<br \\/>\\n(Sungsup Ra is Director Human and Social Development Division, South Asia Regional Department.

This was again reported in an article published in The Guardian on April 6, this year, making headlines in local newspapers. On the following day, the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) said no contraceptives were administered to Sri Lankan female migrant workers and added that only a medical check-up is conducted prior to these Sri Lankans leaving the country.

She was 21 years old by that time. Lack of employment opportunities in her area made her choose migration to the Gulf as the survival strategy. Deceived by the pretty image painted by local travel agents about a housemaid job, Gauri decided to fly to Saudi Arabia which is considered to be the most favoured destination of housemaids. But in reality this&nbsp; nation is the hardest for housemaids to do their jobs. Gauri, who was desperate to provide education for her daughter and bear all her expenses, was thrilled by the commission worth Rs. 200,000 which she received from the sub-agent.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>She said details of her passport were falsified by the travel agent in order to meet the age requirement which is 25.

Ratnasiri, Medroxy Progesterone Acetate (Depo-Provera) is a Progestogen commonly used for female contraception. It suppresses ova production and ovulation and also causes thickening of cervical mucus in the uterus. Both these properties prevent conception and it is a highly effective method of contraception, Dr. Ratnasiri said.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1526485911-06457f9d76.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: 218px; margin: 7px; float: left;\\\" \\/>He outlined that offering any method of family planning needs thorough counseling by a medical professional who&rsquo;ll look into the details of why it&rsquo;s required, advantages and its disadvantages.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">He said this drug, which can be injected at any stage during menstruation, is effective from the day of administration for twelve weeks.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>&ldquo;Women leaving as housemaids to Middle Eastern countries may be susceptible for rape and sexual harassment. Yet, it is unethical and dangerous to inject Medroxy Progesterone Acetate without proper <\\/strong><strong>counseling<\\/strong><strong> and obtaining her consent. I feel it is a violation of women&rsquo;s rights,&rdquo; Gynaecologist Ratnasiri said.<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">He explained that it is always important to identify the disease condition of a woman, assess the safety of the drug and then counsel the couple about the advantages and disadvantages of the method before offering it.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;Some of the disease conditions contraindicating this injection are migraine, headache, women at high risk of thromboembolism, active liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, hypertension with cardiovascular disease and stroke,&rdquo; he said.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">However, it poses a serious question as to whether the so-called medical staffers in these private medical centres, which are unmonitored by the Government, comprise experts and qualified people who are tasked with evaluating these medical factors before administering the Depo injection.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>Side effects of the drug&nbsp;<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">In females, the most common side effects of Depo are acne, changes in menstrual flow, drowsiness and the causing of birth defects in the instance of being used by those pregnant. Other common side effects include breast tenderness, increased facial hair, decreased scalp hair, difficulty in sleeping or remaining asleep, stomach pain, and weight loss or gain. According to the doctor, when the injection is taken for more than two years it increases the risk of Osteoporosis which can lead to bone fractures.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Since 2000 Gauri has been travelling to Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Jordan every two years. By the time we interviewed her, it was three months since she had returned from Saudi. She has been taking the Depo injection every two years. She is now fully aware why the injection is administered and what kind of role the injection plays in her body.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;I am prepared to fly to Kuwait on May 21. Now, I am expecting my menses on May 18 and hope to visit Colombo and get the Depo injection,&rdquo; she said.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Dr. Ratnasiri said that the constant use of the Depo injection, as any other contraceptive, can have a great impact on the female body. Gauri is experiencing various difficulties with regard to her health after she started taking the injection.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>&ldquo;I get menses thrice during a month. Bleeding thrice during a month makes me physically weak. I am going abroad to work as a housemaid. I am responsible <\\/strong><strong>in<\\/strong><strong> looking after kids in the employer&rsquo;s house, cooking, cleaning and doing all other household work. I take few hours of sleep. I don&rsquo;t even get nourishing food,&rdquo; she narrated her ordeal.<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">She said this irregular menstrual cycle has even affected her mental health.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>&ldquo;At times, I suffer from depression, tiredness, anger and even experience sleep disorders. When I develop these health difficulties at work, I have to suffer more in the house because all <\\/strong><strong>what the<\\/strong><strong> employers need is work,&rdquo; she said.<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Gauri is now 39 years old. She is currently preparing to go to Kuwait. Her 18-year-old daughter is living with her grandmother (Gauri&rsquo;s mother). Although she is still <img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1526486025-885eb13b84.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: 227px; margin: 7px; float: left;\\\" \\/>experiencing all these troubles while working as a housemaid in the Gulf, she still wants to continue working abroad.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my daughter to face the same situation I experienced. I will struggle to give her a beautiful future. She will not even think of flying to the Middle East to work as a housemaid,&rdquo; she said.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Gauri&rsquo;s is just one among many stories from Valaichchenai. Many women who have undergone the same &ndash; may be worse&mdash;experiences can be found in the area. Lakshmi is one of them. She started her career back in 1990 at the age of 28. She stopped going to the Gulf in 2012. She is now 56.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Lakshmi told the Daily Mirror that she was also given the same Depo injection repeatedly during the 22 years she was employed as a housemaid.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1526485928-61ed7a5b87.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: 222px; margin: 7px; float: left;\\\" \\/>&ldquo;I have experienced severe abdominal pains and headaches. I cannot explain in words how much I suffered due to the effects of the injection. Contraceptive options that are safe and appropriate for one woman may not work for another. Why don&rsquo;t these doctors know about it? Why do these agents and even doctors play with our bodies,&rdquo; she asked.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>According to Lakshmi, there are several women in her area who had worked in Saudi as housemaids before getting married. Later, when they got married, they had not been able to conceive a baby. &ldquo;Due to the constant use of Depo, they became sterile,&rdquo; Lakshmi said.<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;When they could not give a baby to their husbands, their mothers-in-law asked them to leave the house. Can anyone understand the pathetic situation these innocent women are in ?&rdquo; said she.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Neither Gauri nor Lakshmi had a single document to prove the injection was given. They said it is normally not documented.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1526485940-7f6686414b.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: 265px; margin: 7px; float: left;\\\" \\/>Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror spoke to Rahini Bhaskaran, Coordinator of Inayam Migrants Network, an organisation working for safe migration. She said, as an activist and also as a woman, she is very disappointed in the silent approach the GoSL is taking without punishing those who are responsible for these acts.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">She said that most of these women were not informed about what tests were being performed and why they were performed. &ldquo;They were not even given their medical certificates. The travel agents attached to GAMCA Medical Centers are taking care of it. Those who perform these check-ups do not follow medical standards,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>&ldquo;Every single woman has a right to decide what&rsquo;s good for her body. The right to bodily autonomy and integrity guarantees the right of all individuals to refuse unwanted medical treatment. They have already faced various difficulties at their homes. Such illegal practices double their difficulties. This is unfair and inhumane. This administration of contraceptive injection has to be stopped,&rdquo; affirmed Bhaskaran.<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">The Daily Mirror also spoke with several travel agents operating in Colombo area. Jaffer of New Kingdom Manpower in Borella said according to new rules the Depo injection is not administered.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;New rules and regulations advise not to give the contraceptive injection to housemaids anymore. Accordingly, only MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) injection is given to both male and female migrant workers,&rdquo; he said.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>When specifically asked about the Depo injection, Jaffer said he was not aware of any medical vaccines given to migrant workers since he was not interested in the subject. He said that his only concern is to take care of recruitment procedure of the migrant workers and make sure it is done in a law-abiding manner.<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;When we send a migrant worker to any of the GAMCA medical centers, it is mandatory for her to undergo the medical check-up. If its results are okay, she is given the MMR vaccine. We have nothing to do with the medical matters pertaining to workers. We don&rsquo;t bother about those matters,&rdquo; he said.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">According to Jaffer, the main two reasons for the Sri Lankan housemaids to return before the contract expires are contracting Tuberculosis (TB) or getting pregnant.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Readers might query as to why the effect of the injection lasts for only three months? What would happen if the housemaids get pregnant after three months?<br \\/>\\nJaffer had answers to those questions.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1526485963-89f4594fb0.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: 277px; margin: 7px; float: left;\\\" \\/><strong>According to him, there is a three-months probation in the contract of employment which every housemaid is subject to. As per the contract, if a housemaid gets pregnant during the first three months of employment, the relevant travel agent will be responsible <\\/strong><strong>in<\\/strong><strong> bringing her back to Sri Lanka, bearing the travel cost. Not only the travel cost, the agent will also have to take care of the expenses <\\/strong><strong>in<\\/strong><strong> filling the job vacancy by recruiting another housemaid.<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>As per the contract, travel agents are bound to make sure that these housemaids will not get pregnant within the first three months. After the first three months, the responsibility of housemaids is transferred from Sri Lankan travel agent to the relevant employer.<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;If they get pregnant after three months, we are not responsible in finding a replacement. It is the GCC law,&rdquo; he said. Jaffer&rsquo;s revelation indicated the obvious reason why agents ask housemaids to take the contraceptive injection.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Faroos Marikkar, another travel agent, spoke to the Daily Mirror regarding the Depo issue. He has been in the foreign employment field for the past thirty five years.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>In another startling revelation, he said that the GAMCA had instructed agents to submit a guarantee that the migrant worker will not get physically unfit during the first three months of her contract. The loved ones of these housemaids opine that it is ridiculous how a recruitment <\\/strong><strong>agent<\\/strong><strong> can give a medical guarantee to this effect. He was of the view that the guarantee is used as a shield by the medical <\\/strong><strong>centers<\\/strong><strong> in order to avoid any payments to the travel agents in case the migrant worker is found to be physically unfit during the probation period.<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Meanwhile, Faroos also explained why the Depo injection is given to housemaids.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;A huge amount of money is paid to a housemaid as a commission before she is sent to the country. According to the GCC laws, if a woman gets pregnant while working there, she is sent back to where she came from. If this happens during the first three months, we are in trouble. When they return, it is very difficult to recover the lost money from them,&rdquo; he said.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>During the interview, Faroos called a Manager of a medical center known to him. The lady said Depo is no longer administrated in her medical center which is also supervised by the GAMCA.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Medical&rsquo; staffers unqualified<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>She told Faroos that a housemaid had died of severe negative effects of Depo injection three years ago. Following this death, she said her medical center had stopped giving the injection. She did not mention about the details of this death.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/storiesbypiyumifonseka.files.wordpress.com\\/2019\\/02\\/image_1526485980-8c12223f8564573623.jpg?w=300&amp;h=215\\\" style=\\\"float: left;\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, Faroos alleged that medical staffs working in GAMCA medical centers are neither qualified nor experienced doctors.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t these women go to a government hospital and get the check-ups ? Government hospitals are heavens compared to these small medical centers which don&rsquo;t even have proper facilities. As this is a business, these medical centers are concerned about profit and loss. Therefore, they hire cheap medical professionals,&rdquo; he claimed.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>He was of the view that inaction and negligence on the part of the government had become a blessing for these private medical centers. He emphasized that the Government should take over and monitor all areas of the foreign employment field.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;These medical centers sometimes issue false medical certificates. We send women because we have confidence in the medical certification. But, we often have to face much financial losses when migrant workers are found to be physically unfit just after landing in the respective countries,&rdquo; he remarked.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Both the travel agents said that the administration of the Depo injection has been stopped. Even an official from the Association of Licensed Foreign Employment Agencies (established under Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) Act no. 21 of 1985) also said that this practice had been stopped several years ago.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The writer contacted four private medical centers operating under the supervision of the GAMCA in the suburbs of Colombo under the guise of another desperate woman expecting to travel to Saudi in search of employment as a housemaid.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>A laboratory officer of MediLab (Pvt) Ltd located in Colombo said the the administration of Depo injection is still happening at their workplace.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>MediSense Laboratory (Pvt) Ltd in Battaramulla and Ohlums Clinic and Laboratories in Colombo 08 said the Depo injection is administered by their medical staff to housemaids under their informed consent. Those who are unwilling to receive the injection must submit a guarantee from their respective travel agents.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>A spokesperson of Blue Cross Medical Centre (Pvt) Ltd in Rajagiriya said they only provide housemaids with MMR injections.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The HRW report in 2007 said that the labour agent or sub-agent coerced some women into getting the birth control injection. In some cases, labour agents told domestic workers that if they declined the injected contraceptive, the agency would not assist them if they became pregnant, even in the case of being raped by their employers.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>According to the HRW report, an SLBFE official confirmed that the bureau is aware that &ldquo;there is a tendency&rdquo; for contraceptive injections to be administered to prospective domestic workers during the compulsory medical exam, although it is not a Government policy.The SLBFE reports that it hasn&rsquo;t received complaints from migrant workers regarding the administration of contraceptives. Some domestic workers reported that they didn&rsquo;t complain about the administration of contraceptives because they were not aware of their right to refuse the injectable contraceptive. In some cases they did not know what medication had been administered.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Attempts made to contact R.K. M. P. Randeniya, Deputy General Manager of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB), were futile. However, another highly placed source attached to the SLFEB, speaking on terms of anonymity, said that they are fully aware of the administration of contraceptive injection on housemaids.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;This is not legal. This is a human rights violation. But, this practice is taking place unofficially. We have no control over the operations of the GAMCA or any of their private medical centers.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think even the Ministry of Health is monitoring how these medical check-ups are carried out. There is no proper mechanism to address this problem. Since the GAMCA and its medical centres are controlled by the GCC specified rules and regulations, the scope for the GoSL to get involved in the issue is very limited,&rdquo; the source stated.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Proving the agents&rsquo; claims, the SLFEB official said many Gulf countries demand a three-month guarantee that the housemaid will not become pregnant. In case if she is found pregnant within that period, agents take full responsibility regarding the housemaid. Agents with the support of the GAMCA are administering this injection to housemaids to avoid incurring any extra expenses in the case a pregnancy takes place,&rdquo; he explained.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;A permanent visa is issued to housemaids only if they complete the three months (100 days) duration without getting pregnant. The local agents are responsible only within the 100 days,&rdquo; he added.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Seriously endangers health<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/storiesbypiyumifonseka.files.wordpress.com\\/2019\\/02\\/depo-56a1c4193df78cf7726dc0e91447428826.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200\\\" style=\\\"float: left; height: 133px; width: 200px;\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>According to US media reports, over two million women around the world rely on contraception (a synthetic hormone) manufactured by a U.S.-based multinational, the Upjohn Company.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The drug&rsquo;s nickname around the world is &ldquo;The Shot.&rdquo; Depo differs from most other contraceptive drugs in that it is injectable; one &ldquo;shot&rdquo; can prevent pregnancy for three months. Injected into the arm or buttock in a 150 millilitre dose, one shot of Depo-Provera lasts at least three months. Experts have stated that Depo users may be seriously endangering their health.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>In the US, because of possible safety issues Depo-Provera has never been approved for use as a contraceptive. The current law prohibits the export of drugs banned or unapproved for use in the U.S. to other countries. Upjohn gets around that restriction by producing the drug in Belgium and Canada &ndash; two of about 80 countries including Sri Lanka where Depo-Provera is registered or approved as a contraceptive.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The use of the drug as a contraceptive is prohibited in the US, the place where the drug was originated. Yet, its widespread use in Africa and other underdeveloped countries, including Sri Lanka, according to some critics, queries whether an unsafe drug is being peddled to a largely illiterate and uneducated public.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The Daily Mirror contacted the GAMCA expecting answers to all these questions. They ruled out the administration of Depo to housemaids.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/storiesbypiyumifonseka.files.wordpress.com\\/2019\\/02\\/gamca-india1688265006.jpg?w=300&amp;h=191\\\" style=\\\"float: left; height: 127px; width: 200px;\\\" \\/>According to the GAMCA, there are 14 medical centres in Sri Lanka that are registered and licensed by the Private Health Services Regulatory Council of Sri Lanka, which have been approved by the Gulf Health Council [A central organisation whose members are the Health Ministries of the GCC States working towards a common goal for health standards among the 07 GCC States] to issue pre-departure medical certification prior to granting of entry visa to GCC States for persons travelling from Sri Lanka.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/storiesbypiyumifonseka.files.wordpress.com\\/2019\\/02\\/go-gcc-flag-map1520256605.png?w=300&amp;h=143\\\" style=\\\"float: left;\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Responding to questions in an email interview, the GAMCA Colombo in its replies said that the purpose of the pre-departure health screening is to verify that persons travelling are free from certain communicable and non-communicable diseases as stipulated by the Gulf Health Council.

Doctors have said that the monthly menstrual cycle affects the way signals pass through female brains. After being affected by the constant use of Depo injection, women like Gauri and Lakshmi are suffering both physically and mentally.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The HRW report recommended a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately, these Sri Lankan housemaids are considered as &lsquo;instrumental&rsquo; to the development of the country. The significant role played by housemaids should be recognized and respected. What housemaids are vulnerable to should be recognized and proper steps should be taken to minimize such difficulties.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Desperate housemaids migrate to build a house, purchase land, pay off debts, escape from abusive spouses, pay for education-related costs for their children, pay for the care of the sick, unemployed, or elderly relatives, provide dowries for themselves or their children, meet their families&rsquo; daily needs for food and clothing, replace family resources depleted due to alcohol depending husbands, and purchase necessary equipment for micro-enterprises they planned to launch, the HRW stated in its report.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>These housemaids have already endured so much. It is vital to explore the circumstances of each woman and make her aware of the matters related to the contraceptive. What&rsquo;s disappointing is how the Government authorities were quick to rule out the administration of the Depo and spoke to the media as if this practice has never existed.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The Government authorities may be fully aware of the Depo practice, yet their hands may be tied so that they are unable to take any action against those operating within a powerful travel agents network or these medical organizations which are under the control of the &lsquo;all powerful&rsquo; Gulf Health Council.

The Portuguese didn&rsquo;t build these waterways for fun and we in turn have to keep them clean and take maximum use of them. In fact it is important to create awareness among people, so that they are consciously disposing garbage. If we go to a foreign country, we wouldn&rsquo;t act the same way we act in our own country. We would think twice before throwing a toffee wrapper but here we tend to do it anywhere. I believe that people in big companies should take the initiative to reduce the use of plastic and produce items which are reusable and biodegradable,&rdquo;the member said.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">The waterways protect the city from flooding, but people carelessly dump garbage. Even for the slightest rain Colombo goes under water and therefore it is important that these waterways are cleared and are used more effectively. The waste from these canals and waterways end up in the lakes and eventually in the sea and it has now become a vicious cycle. The Nokunu Team receives continuous support from the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) which is involved in wetland management.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1534882330-7b3320748d.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 620px; height: 466px;\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>The Nokunu Team clears garbage<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) too has extended its fullest support to take this initiative forward.

European issuers have dominated yet again capturing over 50 percent market share, while Asia Pacific clocked just over 30 percent, with China, not surprisingly, accounting for abouttwo-thirds of the&nbsp;region&rsquo;s issuance.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nTo start with, the reference to green bonds now has become a lot broader: the market has started to distinguish between the various subsets of sustainable bond financing with a clear demarcation between green, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), sustainability and social bonds. Non-green only counterparts have increasingly become more topical and have increased their share to nearly 20 percent in 2018 as a percentage of total sustainable bond financing, from a practically non-existent baseprior to 2016.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nJapanese investors, for example, are very focused on the social elements, where more innovative thematic bonds referencing social themes are quite the flavour of the day for the private placement market. Infact, most recently, the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum launched the Sustainability and Social Bond frameworks as the base standard for the 10 ASEAN nations &ndash; a move essentially to harmonise taxonomies in the region.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nSDG bonds however, bring together both social and climate themes via focusing the use of proceeds onto 17 recognised SDGs of the United Nations (UN). The goals recognise that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and addresses a range of social needs including education, health, social protection, and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and environmental protection. To put this in numbers the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates that achieving the SDGs by 2030 will require US$3.9 trillion to be invested in developing countries each year. It also notes that with annual investment of only US$1.4 trillion, the annual investment gap is US$2.5 trillion.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n<strong>Nascent stage<\\/strong><br \\/>\\nSDG bonds, though still at a nascent stage, are getting increasingly topical as prominent issuers are looking internally to align their business models and develop SDG taxonomies modelled on a cluster of these goals. Companies are increasingly stepping up their efforts to communicate to the market which goals are primary or secondary given the nature of their businesses, and how they seek to re-orient themselves to achieving these targets. SDG bonds are hence a stamp of a tangible progress in this journey<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe World Bank has been a prominent innovator in the SDG bond market, having already raised such financing in different markets, each targeted towards a separate set of SDG clusters. Most recently we placed the world&rsquo;s first ever &lsquo;blue bond&rsquo; for the Republic of Seychelles. This was on the back of a partial World Bank guarantee to support the marine economy of Seychelles.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nDespite the small size of US$15million, it was fully placed with sustainable, responsible and impact investing (SRI) investors. At least US$12 million of the proceeds will be allocated for low-interest loans and grants to local fishermen communities, while the remainder will finance research on sustainable fisheries projects.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe project was notable on many counts as it seeks to establish a framework for further issuances in this space; it combines public and private investment to mobilise resources for empowering local communities and businesses; it was fully placed into SRI portfolios and that it marks Seychelles&rsquo; return to the international capital markets after a hiatus of eight years.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nAs we approach 2019, it is clear that the overall year-on-year growth in this segment has tapered off a bit, partly given the challenging credit conditions this year and also taking into consideration the growth in previous years was meteoric, with markets almost doubling in size in each of the past twoyears. One lesser talked about reason is potentially the lack of market-driven incentives.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThis includes the contentious issue of blending regulatory frameworks with sustainable finance concepts, for example, by allowing for haircuts on risk-weight assets (RWAs) pertaining to such exposures, allowing for better repurchase agreement&nbsp; eligibility to make these bonds more liquid versus their conventional counterparts, and more. These have their set of challenges given sustainable financing has more of a best practices approach as opposed a legal or regulatory framework. This however is changing as most regulators globally are taking a more stringent view on taxonomies and providing rules to limit variations in interpretation.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n<strong>EU taxonomy<\\/strong><br \\/>\\nA notable example was that the European Commission (EU) presented three legislative proposals aimed at establishing an EU taxonomy for sustainable \\ufb01nance, improving environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure, and creating low-carbon benchmarks<br \\/>\\nAnother area to look forward to would be the formulation of state-sponsored sustainability funds, particularly in Asian countries, to gold-plate standards for investments into sustainable bond products, allowing other investors in the region to follow suit.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nFurther, as more of a long-term strategic goal, as organisations re-align themselves to sustainability targets and become more transparent about these frameworks, we will hopefully see an overwhelming majority of fund raising in the green or sustainable format. This would allow the market could look to move to investments based on issuers&rsquo; specific ESG profiles as opposed to evaluating this on a bond by bond basis &ndash; a more holistic approach to sustainable financing.<br \\/>\\n(The writer is Global Head, Credit Markets, Standard Chartered Bank)<\\/p>\\n\",\"ADDED_DATE\":\"2019-01-01 12:12:24\",\"PUBLISH_DATE\":\"2019-01-01 12:11:09\",\"PUBLISH_END_DATE\":null,\"EVENT_DATE\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT1\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT2\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT3\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT4\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT5\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT6\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT7\":\"\",\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT8\":\"\",\"EXTERNAL_URL\":null,\"HITS\":\"823\",\"COMMENTS\":\"0\",\"AUTHOR\":\"134\",\"AUTHOR_NAME\":\"Dineth Rathnayaka\",\"COMMENT_STATUS\":\"1\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"SPECIAL\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_LIST\":\"Features\",\"REGION\":null,\"REGION_NAME\":null,\"KEYWORDS_LIST\":null,\"METATAG_LIST\":null,\"RELATED_LIST\":null,\"SCORE\":\"0.7988201975822449\",\"URL_CATEGORY\":[{\"CATEGORY_ID\":\"185\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"EDITION_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"Features\",\"ALIAS\":\"features\",\"ARTICLE_COUNT\":\"1632\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"PARENT\":\"215\",\"LEAF\":\"1\",\"DEFAULT_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"SPECIAL_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"HIDDEN_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_REGION\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR_ORDER\":\"0\"}],\"IMAGES\":[{\"ARTICLE_FIELD_ID\":\"113479\",\"FIELD_ID\":\"19\",\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"160512\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"FIELD_TITLE\":\"Category Image\",\"FIELD_TYPE\":\"THUMB\",\"FIELD_VALUE\":\"media\\/images\\/image_1546324925-505f7411d2.jpg\",\"STATUS\":\"1\"}]},{\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"161536\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"Apparel industry seeks government help to enter emerging markets \",\"SUBTITLE\":\"\",\"ALIAS\":\"Apparel-industry-seeks-government-help-to-enter-emerging-markets-\",\"INTRO_TEXT\":\"As Sri Lanka&rsquo;s apparel sector has embarked on a journey to achieve US $8 billion in exports by 2025, the industry requested the government&rsquo;s to assistance to enhance a\\n\",\"FULL_TEXT\":\"<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><span style=\\\"font-size:16px;\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#8B4513;\\\"><strong>Sri Lanka&rsquo;s traditional apparel export markets such as US and EU becoming stagnant<\\/strong><\\/span><\\/span><\\/li>\\n\\t<li><span style=\\\"font-size:16px;\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#8B4513;\\\"><strong>Apparel exporters stress need to penetrate more into emerging markets<\\/strong><\\/span><\\/span><\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n<img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1548391082-8da23f0b67.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 350px; height: 253px; float: left; border-width: 4px; border-style: solid; margin: 10px;\\\" \\/><strong>By Nishel Fernando&nbsp;<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>As Sri Lanka&rsquo;s apparel sector has embarked on a journey to achieve US $8 billion in exports by 2025, the industry requested the government&rsquo;s to assistance to enhance access to emerging markets with more free trade pacts and&nbsp;consistent policies.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThis comes in the light of Sri Lanka&rsquo;s traditional apparel export markets, such as the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) becoming stagnant.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n&ldquo;Our traditional market share is more or less static.

SLAEA outgoing Chairman Felix Fernando pointed out that the growing apparel markets of China and India are projected to surpass several developed markets, thereby representing a significant portion of the global apparel consumption.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n&ldquo;All four BRIC nations appear among the top markets having a cumulative share of approximately 23 percent.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n&ldquo;Combined apparel consumption of the US and the EU is 40 percent while they are a home to just 11 per cent of the world&rsquo;s population, implying a very high level per capita expenditure on apparel compared to the rest of the world,&rdquo; he noted.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe US and EU account for nearly 87 percent of Sri Lanka&rsquo;s apparel exports.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n&ldquo;It is true that the US and EU were vital markets in the past and the present, and that without their help, Sri Lanka&rsquo;s apparel industry could not have achieved its glory, and we are indeed grateful to buyers from the US and the EU for having their faith in Sri Lanka during this glorious journey.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nHowever, we simply cannot dwell on past successes. We need to adapt to the aforementioned market changes to continue our industry growth,&rdquo; Fernando asserted.&nbsp;<br \\/>\\nMeanwhile, as global apparel industry is increasingly focusing on near-shoring due to developments in logistics management, where holding minimum amount of inventories and fulfilling small orders in time deliveries gaining traction, Lakhani stressed that Sri Lankan apparel industry must diversify its markets to adapt to these developments.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nFormer Export Development Board (EDB) Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer Indira Malwatte highlighted that Sri Lanka&rsquo;s apparel exports to India have nearly doubled to US $80 million in 2018.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nEven though it represents a fairly small share of Sri Lanka&rsquo;s apparel exports, she pointed out that Sri Lankan apparel exports exceeded the apparel import quota set by India, which indicates the high demand for Sri Lankan apparel in the Indian market.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nLakhani insisted that Sri Lanka should pursue a sectorial liberalisation through the proposed Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA) with India to increase market access for Sri Lankan apparel exporters to that country.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n&ldquo;India is becoming a focal point for the fashion industry as its middle class consumer base is growing and manufacturing sector strengthening. Fashion players must redouble their efforts in this highly fragmented and challenging market where educated and tech savvy demographic rub shoulders with the poor and upwardly mobile, and it is for that reason we have continued to impress upon our government to use bilateral FTAs as a tool for market penetration to these&nbsp; countries&rdquo; he elaborated.<br \\/>\\nAccording to Lakhani, Sri Lanka is importing inputs such as fibre, yarn, fabric and finished apparel products worth of US $700 million from India per annum, while Sri Lanka&rsquo;s apparel exports to India stood at US $80 million in 2018.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nHence he suggested that Sri Lanka should discuss with Indian authorities an interim measure to increase or remove the quota. &ldquo;Any interim measure to enhance the quota of 8 million pieces without attaching strings such as Indian fabric usage would become very handy especially as a confidence building exercise,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;<br \\/>\\nLakhani urged the government to engage in consistent and predictable policy making to ensure that the exporters utilise their resources in marketing their products rather than utilising them to resolve domestic process issues arising from unpredictable and inconsistent policy decisions.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nHe drew attention to serious issues in logistics that the exporters had to go through due unpredictable policy making of the government this year.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n&ldquo;On the domestic front, we started the journey in 2019 with a number of serious issues in hand. The SLPA tariff increase, new shipping policy draft, new procedure for monitoring of export proceeds are some of them,&rdquo; he said.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nHe pointed out the tariff increase lacked a consultative process and the exporters were not given advanced notice to predict additional costs.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nUnderlying other challenges that the apparel industry faces, Lakhani said, &ldquo;Our costs are increasing, we are not sure what is in store for us in the UK; domestic labour market dynamics dictate us to disrupt our business models demanding investments in advanced technology, more up-skilled labour force lean and conscious energy sensitive production environment.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<hr \\/>\\n<p><span style=\\\"color:#FF8C00;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-size:26px;\\\"><strong>Exports top US $ 5bn<\\/strong><\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Sri Lanka apparel industry has surpassed the US$ 5 billion mark in exports for the first time in history.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) in a statement said the total earnings from the export of apparel products falling under HS chapters 61, 62 and 63 amounted to US$ 5, 050 million in 2018, registering an increase of 4.79 percent compared to the export turnover of US$ 4, 819 million in 2017.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The USA and the EU continued to be the two largest buyers of Sri Lankan garments, in both volume and value.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nJAAF said this achievement is in line with the second strategic plan that was prepared for the industry, and this feat was achieved despite many external challenges.<br \\/>\\nLocal textile and apparel industry employs nearly 350,000 workers directly and twice as many indirectly. Total employment is estimated to be in the region of 15 percent of the country&rsquo;s eligible workforce. The majority of this workforce is women from regional areas.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe contribution of the textile and apparel industry to the GDP is around 6 percent based on re-based GDP estimates.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nGiven the development of other sectors, it is very unlikely that any other manufactured export sector will come up to this level of performance in the short to mid-term. Hence, the apparel industry will continue to influence the level of economic development in the mid-term. &ldquo;The desire of the apparel industry is to reach a target of US$ 8 billion by 2025 which requires a 6 percent annual compound growth, which is a very ambitious target.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n&ldquo;While the industry by itself will take all possible steps to meet capacity, technology and resource issues, the envisaged market access programmes through regional, multi-lateral, or bi-lateral trade arrangements are also extremely important particularly with emerging markets such as India, China and Brazil,&rdquo; JAAF said.<br \\/>\\nThe industry is looking forward to raising the bar to the next level with effective public-private partnerships with the government on policy making.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\",\"ADDED_DATE\":\"2019-01-25 10:08:15\",\"PUBLISH_DATE\":\"2019-01-25 10:05:58\",\"PUBLISH_END_DATE\":null,\"EVENT_DATE\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT1\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT2\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT3\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT4\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT5\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT6\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT7\":\"\",\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT8\":\"\",\"EXTERNAL_URL\":null,\"HITS\":\"712\",\"COMMENTS\":\"0\",\"AUTHOR\":\"579\",\"AUTHOR_NAME\":\"layan sathsara\",\"COMMENT_STATUS\":\"1\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"SPECIAL\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_LIST\":\"Business News\",\"REGION\":null,\"REGION_NAME\":null,\"KEYWORDS_LIST\":null,\"METATAG_LIST\":null,\"RELATED_LIST\":null,\"SCORE\":\"0.7988201975822449\",\"URL_CATEGORY\":[{\"CATEGORY_ID\":\"273\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"EDITION_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"Business News\",\"ALIAS\":\"business-news\",\"ARTICLE_COUNT\":\"13920\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"PARENT\":\"215\",\"LEAF\":\"1\",\"DEFAULT_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"SPECIAL_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"HIDDEN_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_REGION\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR_ORDER\":\"0\"}],\"IMAGES\":[{\"ARTICLE_FIELD_ID\":\"114503\",\"FIELD_ID\":\"19\",\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"161536\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"FIELD_TITLE\":\"Category Image\",\"FIELD_TYPE\":\"THUMB\",\"FIELD_VALUE\":\"media\\/images\\/image_1548391075-6c71b6ab81.jpg\",\"STATUS\":\"1\"}]},{\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"30720\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"Hemas - Thailand\\u2019s Minor in US$ 70mn hotel project \",\"SUBTITLE\":\"\",\"ALIAS\":\"hemas-thailands-minor-in-us-70mn-hotel-project-\",\"INTRO_TEXT\":\"Sri Lanka&rsquo;s Hemas Holdings PLC, a family-run conglomerate with a strong presence in FMCG and healthcare sectors has embarked on to develop 3 new hotel properties in partnership with Thai-based Minor Group, a top official of the firm said.\\r\\n\",\"FULL_TEXT\":\"\\r\\n<img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/Hemas.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 90px;

It&rsquo;s about the life of JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera and his bid to change the political history of Sri Lanka through armed insurrection.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">The resulting picture is so confusing that even the final death count varies widely. It was considerable and the damage to the country&rsquo;s psyche even more drastic. The simple fact that no two Sri Lankans having a conversation in the street will trust a third party within earshot is the direct result of these two failed rebellions and the counter-terror which crushed them.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">That even controlled protest such as trade union action isn&rsquo;t allowed in many sectors is another blow to the practice of negotiating democratically. That a very powerful military has a say in our semi-democratic form of government is another disturbing result of Wijeweera&rsquo;s political goals and means. This has its insidious effects of social life as well as the arts. For example, the rule that the depiction of members of the security forces in film needs approval from the censors can hardly be called a democratic practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Rohana Wijeweera is the most fascinating political leader and participant in the country&rsquo;s post-independence politics. More than a participant, he was a mover and a shaker. Much has been written about him, most of it inconclusive and partisan, and a movie was waiting to be made.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Now that it&rsquo;s finally there, what does it tell us? Director Anuruddha Jayasinghe was a student of Thurstan College, Colombo, when he was arrested as a JVP activist during the late 1980s second JVP rebellion. That he sees the movie from a partisan point of view is understandable. That he&rsquo;s an admirer of the late JVP leader is quite acceptable. The trouble is that he seems to have made this historic movie with his heart, not his mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Kamal Addaraarchchi, easily the most promising talent in film in the 1980s, lost his way. But he has made an impressive comeback in the role of Wijeweera, something which undoubtedly called for great commitment and determination. But his performance is marred by flaws in the character as scripted, and let&rsquo;s try to see what these flaws are.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">What we get here is a soft-spoken and benign Wijeweera. He is a moderate, cautionary figure keeping the hotheads in his inner circle at bay. He is a loving family man. In this version, it&rsquo;s his attachment to his family which causes his downfall, when he ignores calls by fellow politburo members to flee his last refuge.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">All that&rsquo;s fine, but is that all there is to a man responsible for two very bloody Sinhalese youth rebellions in modern history? According to some sources, the combined death toll exceeds that of the 30-year civil war with the LTTE. How did he hold the volatile personalities of his politburo (PB) together? How did he deal with dissent?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">These are questions left unanswered by &lsquo;Ginnen Upan Seethala.&rsquo; According to it, the DJV or military wing of the JVP is an independent entity led by its leader Keerthi Wijebahu with a free hand. It&rsquo;s the DJV&rsquo;s rash decisions which led to the failure of the second JVP uprising. Was Wijeweera powerless to intervene or did he lack the political foresight and the will to veto the DJV&rsquo;s disastrous orders to the rank and file? This is hardly credible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><strong>All that&rsquo;s fine, but is that all there is to a man responsible for two very bloody Sinhalese youth rebellions in modern history? According to some sources, the combined death toll exceeds that of the 30-year civil war with the LTTE. How did he hold the volatile personalities of his politburo (PB) together? How did he deal with dissent?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<\\/blockquote>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">The ideological rift with Nandana Marasinghe, one of the more politically astute and dynamic PB leaders, is shown but we see only half the story. Marasinghe&rsquo;s killing was ordered by his fellow PB members including Wijeweera. In the movie, though, the decision what to do with him is postponed by the PB and Nandana Marasinghe isn&rsquo;t heard of any more. Anyone not familiar with this history would assume that Marasinghe disappeared on his own free will.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">This movie leaves more questions unanswered. We see an endless series of PB meetings which dampens the impact of a story which should leave us at the edge of our seats. Less time talking and more time spent with the actual action would have given us the &lsquo;biographical thriller&rsquo; which the brochures promise. As it is, both the biography and the thriller have gaping holes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">To the director&rsquo;s credit, some of the action scenes (such as the ethnic riots, political meetings, and a dramatic scene where military vehicles drive at night through pouring rain) are very well staged. But that&rsquo;s just not enough, and many scenes could have been better edited, for example the scene where a JVP youth orchestra plays early in the story. It&rsquo;s much too long.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">It&rsquo;d be interesting to compare this movie with Stephen Soderberg&rsquo;s&lsquo;Che&rsquo; (2008, in two parts). It was criticised for showing mostly Che the public figure, and little of his private life. With &lsquo;Ginnen Upan Seethala,&rsquo; the criticism is that it shows too much of the private life. Both portraits are sympathetic, but in the latter case we want to know more about Wijweera than just how much he loved his wife and children.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Soderberg&rsquo;s Che is played by Mexican actor Benicio del Toro. He&rsquo;s not an exact look alike, but more importantly he gets under the skin of his character. In our case, Addararachchi doesn&rsquo;t have much to go by as he follows the script which gives us a moderate figure whose bid to enter mainstream democratic politics is thwarted by the autocratic President JR Jayewardene, the villain of the piece.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">In the final analysis, no agreement will ever be reached on that point &ndash; if JR didn&rsquo;t proscribe the JVP, would Wijeweera and his cadres have given up the armed struggle? This is a tricky point. He rejected a peace offer from JR&rsquo;s successor R. Premadasa when the insurrection was at its height. Experience had undoubtedly taught him to distrust the politicians. What did his own nature dictate?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">The movie ends with the arrest of Wijeweera, thus leaving out the harrowing details of his execution. By some accounts, he was shot at the Colombo general cemetery but was still breathing when his body was thrown into the incinerator. This isn&rsquo;t an episode that the country can be proud of?<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">By comparison, Abimail Guzman, the Peruvian leader of Sendoro Luminoso guerrilla movement which led a brutal 20-year-old war against the government of Peru, was spared after his arrest. So were his top aides. Guzman is still in prison but was allowed to marry and helped negotiate a peace settlement with his cadres. This is how our story too, should have ended. Instead, we keep taking grim satisfaction in a smug &lsquo; serve them right&rsquo; attitude while the smouldering socio-political problems which created Rohana Wijeweera continue to smoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Nadeeka Guruge has done an effective score while Dhanushka Gunathilake&rsquo;s cinematography is excellent, especially the outdoor night scenes. The script, editing and some of the acting leaves much to be desired. For example, in a crucial scene where Wijeweera and his PB members react in dismay to the arrest of a colleague, they behave not like hardened revolutionaries but a bunch of schoolboys reacting when their favourite batsman gets out for a duck.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Despite such flaws, this is a historically important film and marks a milestone for the Lankan film industry. Along with &lsquo;Nidahase Piya DS&rsquo; screened last year (about D. S. Senanayake), the political biography is now in demand as subject matter for Sri Lankan films. It&rsquo;s a heartening development.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\",\"ADDED_DATE\":\"2019-02-07 01:39:31\",\"PUBLISH_DATE\":\"2019-02-07

The illicit cultivation, production, distribution and possession of drugs are crimes according to Sri Lankan law. Yet, in spite of these laws, drugs travel in and out of our country through illicit trade while it is estimated that the land area used for illegal cannabis cultivation is 500 hectares. According to information gathered through drug users, the distribution of drugs are mainly done through trishaw drivers and construction workers. They also claim that the importing of drugs is mainly done by people who have political power and mercantile power. With their resources they bring in the drugs which are then distributed to their sub-dealers scattered among the people. These people, in distribution according to Prasadini (25), could be anyone! It could be your pharmacist or your mail man or even your boss. &ldquo;These people may not do drugs themselves. They&rsquo;re just part of the circle who distributes drugs. And their information never goes out of that circle.&rdquo;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#ff0000;\\\"><strong>Illegality of drugs<\\/strong><\\/span><br \\/>\\r\\nNow why exactly is it illegal to use drugs? What is this big harm that they are talking about? According to Professor Ravindra Fernando, senior professor of forensic medicine and toxicology, University of Colombo; former chairman National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB), different drugs have different impacts on our body. For instance alcohol causes impaired judgment, decreased inhibition, coma and even death. It could damage your liver, heart, pancreas, stomach and brain and could also result in sexual impotency. Barbiturate drugs gives you relief from stress and anxiety but it results in loss of motor coordination, decreased self control, slurred speech, impaired judgment, confusion and drowsiness; Overdose of it can cause coma. Ecstasy, which is mostly famous in night clubs causes health issues such as the increase of heart rate and blood pressure, brain and liver damage and even sudden death.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nCannabis or weed is the only drug that grows in Sri Lanka. It is used in Ayurvedic medicine. The non-medical consumption of this drug causes&nbsp; impaired performance, sleepiness, confusion and hallucinations.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nAmphetamines or slimming pills could also cause increased alertness, loss of appetite, dilated pupils, sweating, blood pressure and violent behaviour.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nCocaine abuse leads to nasal septum, keratitis of the eyes, dental erosion, fits, heart muscle disease, coronary artery and liver disease, brain hemorrhages and sudden cardiac death.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nHeroin causes a sense of contentment and detachment from emotional and physical distress but it results in drowsiness, lack of concentration, respiratory depression and sudden death. It also causes serious withdrawal issues such as anxiety, restlessness, sweating, yawning, running nose, watering eyes, diarrhoea, and incontinence of urine, abdominal pains, muscle cramps, hallucinations and delusions when the drug is not in the blood. The injecting of the drug could also result in overdose, bronchopneumonia and hepatitis.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#ff0000;\\\"><strong>Why drugs?<\\/strong><\\/span><br \\/>\\r\\nSenior lecturer of the Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Dr Mahesh Rajasuriya explains that drugs can negatively impact upon one&rsquo;s mental condition as well. Depending on the amount of drug consumption and depending on the type of drug, these impacts could vary.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nSo if drugs are so bad, why do people do drugs? Out of the three drug users that I interviewed, two of them; Prasadini (25) and Thisuri (23), claimed that the only reason they tried out drugs was out of curiosity while Seneth (23) said that he saw it as a part of attaining manhood. Their ideas on drugs seem to portray the sociological viewpoint on drugs for according to Dr Chandani Liyanage of the Sociology Department from the University of Colombo who says; &ldquo;very often it is&nbsp; curiosity that drives a person to try out drugs. Especially due to the influence of media which highlights issues such as celebrity world drug abuse and sports stars using drugs for energy boosts, the curiosity of the young mind is naturally aroused to experience this forbidden fruit.&rdquo; She further stated that the social pressure and the peer pressure are also leading factors that drive a person to do drugs. &ldquo;Sometimes the society expects it. It is considered as a sign of manhood and a measurement of luxury. The party without liquor is considered a disgrace. Yet it is the upper classes that tries out drugs for the fun of it whereas the lower classes are more like driven into it as an escape from the social pressure that they are subjected to&rdquo; she pointed out. &ldquo;But it is important to note that the people who are driven to drugs by all these social forces are generally people with weak personalities. In fact, in most cases, drug users are people who are coming from broken families or have been subjected to childhood violence.&rdquo;<br \\/>\\r\\nRonald Amarasekara who is the director of the Yauwana Sahana Sevaya (YSS); a rehabilitation centre located in Kandana, also holds a similar opinion. &ldquo;The vulnerability to drugs depends on so many factors. One is personality; a person of a weak personality is more vulnerable to drugs. The upbringing of the person, the socio-cultural back ground of the individual; all these facts contribute to personality development. Another element is the family background. If the family environment encourages the use of drugs then kids will definitely get on to drugs.&rdquo; However,&nbsp; Amarasekara does not seem to agree that curiosity factor is an acceptable reason for a person to get on to drugs. &ldquo;We all have our own curiosities. But just because you&rsquo;re curious would you pick up all the junk on the road just to know what it tastes like? You wouldn&rsquo;t, because you have a sense to differentiate between what you should try and should not try. So if someone chooses to try out like drugs while knowing that it is bad for them, then there is some misconstruction in his personality.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/Untitled-5(55).jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 1073px;\\\" \\/><br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#ff0000;\\\"><strong>Addiction and social conditioning<\\/strong><\\/span><br \\/>\\r\\nResponding to the false belief held by some drug addicts&nbsp; that as long as one stays away from strong drugs such as heroin, he or she could use drugs without getting addicted to it,&nbsp; Amarasekara&nbsp; said &ldquo;I have met people like that too. And the question I ask them is &lsquo;if you&rsquo;re not addicted to it why don&rsquo;t quit?&rsquo; The truth is, once you start using drugs you get addicted. Drug users know that and they come up with these excuses to console themselves.&rdquo;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nSome drug addicts foolishly cling on to the belief that drugs such as weed help them to calm down helps&nbsp; creativeness. Psychiatric Mahesh Rajasuriya, explained this phenomenon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sub-cultural belief that often reflects in your drug habits. If the sub-culture says that you should drink liquor when you&rsquo;re stressed or smoke when you&rsquo;re lonely, then you would follow the same concept not because the drug has a special effect, but because of your unconscious submission to that belief. Being creative after using drugs, confidence to sing or dance or speak out your mind after using drugs are all sub-cultural beliefs more than the effects of the drug. If the sub-culture suggests that a &ldquo;kudukaraya&rdquo; is someone who doesn&rsquo;t bathe or shave and is someone who behaves like a gangster then the drug user will submit to that image.&nbsp; Drugs make users drowsy but sometimes the excessive consumption of weeds can result in panic attacks. And sometimes the struggle for money to afford drug habits could lead to aggressive behaviour.&rdquo;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nDr. Chandani Liyanage stated that the usage of drugs it due to weakening social norms. &ldquo;When a society goes through rapid changes, norms lose their values and it leads to social chaos. Drug abuse is a result of this state and thus it is not the fault of the individual but the fault of the prevailing social structure. For example a sex worker may be forced to use drugs by her customers. In the urban lower class societies, children are trained since childhood to deal drugs.&rdquo;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nDr Balasuriya also pointed out that accessibility to drugs is another factor that precipitates vulnerability to drugs. This statement reaffirms Dr Liyanage who said that drugs are an everyday item in the lives of the lower class. &ldquo;Just as your children receive school education, these children are taught how to deal in illegal drugs.&rdquo;<br \\/>\\r\\nWhile the story of the lower class is such, discussions with drug users revealed that even among the upper or middle social classes, there is accessibility to drugs. While night clubs are the well-known &ldquo;spots&rdquo; to purchase drugs, they are made available at universities and pharmacies and even schools. Seneth (23) says; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s usually reputed people with political connections that import drugs. I know someone who has a shipping company and he imports drugs through his own ships. Sometimes they use private busses to distribute drugs. Prices and all vary from area to area. For example 10mg of &ldquo;Churchill&rdquo; will cost around Rs 2000 in Negombo while it costs Rs 300 in Colombo and Peradeniya.&rdquo;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nSo if drugs are made so conveniently available then what can be done to get rid of this menace? According to Dr Liyanage, the biggest mistake that the Sri Lankan authorities are making is that they are trying to control the supply of drugs when what they really should do is to try and control the demand. She believes that &ldquo;if the demand for drugs is wiped out then the supply would eventually fade away.&rdquo; She also pointed out that &ldquo;in most developed countries, the school curriculum itself educates students on the consequences of drug abuse; through making them study real life incidents.&nbsp; What happens in our society is that the topic is being neglected completely and the young generation driven by curiosity falls right into the trap.&rdquo; Another drawback in our society is&nbsp; social labelling. &ldquo;Sometimes when a person goes through rehabilitation and comes back ready to start afresh, society is not ready to give him a chance since he is already labelled as a &ldquo;kudukaraya&rdquo; or &ldquo;bebadda&rdquo;.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#ff0000;\\\"><strong>Listen to users<\\/strong><\\/span><br \\/>\\r\\nSo what are the chances of a person who is misled by drugs to start life all over again? Here are some interesting messages to share with all the drug users and&nbsp; curious audiences.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nShantha Nirmal (30); &ldquo;If you are a heavy smoker then you are that much close to getting on to drugs. Because once the smoking ceases to give you the desired effect you would eventually be driven to something stronger. That&rsquo;s how I got on to&nbsp; heroin. It destroyed everything in my life. If recognized at a very early stage it can be cured completely. But the longer one has been using drugs the harder it is to recover. What&rsquo;s even stronger than the physical addiction is the mental addiction. It was the hardest part to get over. I managed to recover from drugs thanks to the help of YSS and after getting out of the centre I had to pick up my life again. If there is&nbsp; someone in your family who&rsquo;s doing drugs I have only two questions; how can you love your family and the rest of the world if you don&rsquo;t love yourself? And how can you claim to love yourself if you are consuming something that&rsquo;s destroying you?&rdquo;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/Drug-addiction.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 503px;\\\" \\/><br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nSudarshana Suppaiyah (37): &ldquo;I began drugs out of curiosity. I was just a fifteen-year old then. When I couldn&rsquo;t find the money to afford it, I stole and I even got jailed.&nbsp; I was a black sheep of my family and even my wife rejected me. Looking back I regret all those years I wasted on drugs.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nIt took me a long time to completely recover from drugs despite the help from YSS because I was addicted to it for too long. What every man needs is to be happy. But if you think that drugs can bring you happiness then you couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong. True happiness cannot be obtained&nbsp; by injecting a chemical into your body. The further away you are from drugs, the happier you will be.&rdquo;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#696969;\\\"><em><strong>(The names of the drug victims&nbsp;&nbsp; were changed to shield their identities)<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/span><br \\/>\",\"ADDED_DATE\":\"2014-02-18 04:46:31\",\"PUBLISH_DATE\":\"2014-02-18 04:46:31\",\"PUBLISH_END_DATE\":null,\"EVENT_DATE\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT1\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT2\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT3\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT4\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT5\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT6\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT7\":\"\",\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT8\":\"\",\"EXTERNAL_URL\":null,\"HITS\":\"1833\",\"COMMENTS\":\"0\",\"AUTHOR\":\"113\",\"AUTHOR_NAME\":\"Deeptha Wijayasekara\",\"COMMENT_STATUS\":\"1\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"SPECIAL\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_LIST\":\"Opinion\",\"REGION\":null,\"REGION_NAME\":null,\"KEYWORDS_LIST\":null,\"METATAG_LIST\":null,\"RELATED_LIST\":null,\"SCORE\":\"0.7988201975822449\",\"URL_CATEGORY\":[{\"CATEGORY_ID\":\"172\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"EDITION_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"Opinion\",\"ALIAS\":\"opinion\",\"ARTICLE_COUNT\":\"9669\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"PARENT\":\"231\",\"LEAF\":\"1\",\"DEFAULT_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"SPECIAL_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"HIDDEN_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_REGION\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR_ORDER\":\"0\"}],\"IMAGES\":[{\"ARTICLE_FIELD_ID\":\"33734\",\"FIELD_ID\":\"19\",\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"43264\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"FIELD_TITLE\":\"Category Image\",\"FIELD_TYPE\":\"THUMB\",\"FIELD_VALUE\":\"media\\/images\\/04(189).jpg\",\"STATUS\":\"1\"}]},{\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"111360\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"Softlogic Finance introduces Education Loans\",\"SUBTITLE\":\"\",\"ALIAS\":\"Softlogic-Finance-introduces-Education-Loans\",\"INTRO_TEXT\":\"Softlogic Finance PLC has introduced &lsquo;Softlogic Finance Education Loans&rsquo;, thereby supporting parents\\n\",\"FULL_TEXT\":\"<p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1466605311-16635aefc0.jpg\\\" style=\\\"float:left; height:273px; width:300px\\\" \\/>Softlogic Finance PLC has introduced &lsquo;Softlogic Finance Education Loans&rsquo;, thereby supporting parents in fulfilling their aspirations of providing the best possible education for their children and assisting youth in &lsquo;climbing the career ladder&rsquo; by obtaining academic and\\/or professional qualifications.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nAmounts ranging from Rs.150,000 to Rs.10 million can be obtained under the scheme, launched by Softlogic Finance in recognition of the enormous growth potential of the country&rsquo;s fast-expanding education sector.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nUnder Softlogic Finance&rsquo;s Education Loans scheme, parents (acting as principal borrowers) can obtain funds for their children&rsquo;s overseas education (including academic\\/course fees and living expenses) and even to finance the admission fees for private\\/international schools.

She is backed by the International Institute of Peace Through Tourism and Skal International, along with 12 sponsors including AIG and Air New Zealand, and a solid handful of supporters.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nSince July of last year, De Pecol has been to 74 countries across six continents, addressing over 4,000 students and dignitaries. She is simultaneously volunteering for an organisation called Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation, collecting water samples to test the world&rsquo;s waterways for micro plastics. The dynamic adventurer is also filming an educational documentary geared towards high school and university students, so that her message can continue to reach the youth long after her Expedition has successfully been completed. She has plans of a universal project that will aim towards addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Her key to success has been keeping an open mind to new opportunities.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nDuring her sojourn in Sri Lanka, she met tourism students, Minister of Tourism, Dignitaries and Skal Associates. She also embarked on an interesting journey, collecting footage from local people, asking them what their definition of &lsquo;Kindness&rsquo;. She plans to promote Sri Lanka in the US-based Hooplaha Good News media.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nCassandra De Pecol said, &ldquo;The purpose of my visit to Sri Lanka is to inspire and educate the tourism students, plant the tree with the students and dignitaries to signify responsible tourism, and promote Sri Lanka in the international media on my end.&rdquo; She belies that companies practicing sustainable tourism hold many advantages. By supporting organisations that follow sustainable\\/regenerative policies, the communities and economy will benefit because the core mission of organisations who practice sustainability is to give back to communities through job employment and increased infrastructure.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n&ldquo;By developing infrastructure centered on sustainable development, the company has the opportunity to lessen costs of energy output through use of solar, low flow shower systems, lessening water usage costs, using local products and produce that decreases transportation costs and emissions and so on,&rdquo; she points out.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nIn the past, she has completed a survival challenge for Discovery Channel for a 21-day experiment to survive in the wilderness of Panama along with three teammates. &ldquo;This was the best, worst experience of my entire life!&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I learned a lot about myself and how I work with others. The experience itself was life changing and I do not regret the survival experience.&rdquo; The self-starter even obtained a prestigious internship with Solimar International, funded by USAID, in the Bolivian Amazon for two months as a Sustainability\\/Marketing Advisor to small tour companies.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nDe Pecol has many accomplishments to her name despite her young age. She was invited to attend the IIPT World Symposium in Johannesburg, South Africa, to meet with Naomi King (Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s sister-in-law), Nandi Mandela (Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s Granddaughter) and Taleb Rifai, the UN Secretary General for Tourism. She also had her first TEDx Talk in front of students at a high school in Los Angeles. She has attended the World Travel and Tourism Council Global Summit in Madrid, Spain where she met with the King of Spain, Felipe VI, eventually launching Expedition 196 at the World Domination Summit in Portland, Oregon, organised by Author, Chris Guillebeau.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\",\"ADDED_DATE\":\"2016-08-05 17:22:10\",\"PUBLISH_DATE\":\"2016-08-06 00:00:28\",\"PUBLISH_END_DATE\":null,\"EVENT_DATE\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT1\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT2\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT3\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT4\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT5\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT6\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT7\":\"\",\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT8\":\"\",\"EXTERNAL_URL\":null,\"HITS\":\"668\",\"COMMENTS\":\"0\",\"AUTHOR\":\"569\",\"AUTHOR_NAME\":null,\"COMMENT_STATUS\":\"1\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"SPECIAL\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_LIST\":\"Lifestyle\",\"REGION\":null,\"REGION_NAME\":null,\"KEYWORDS_LIST\":null,\"METATAG_LIST\":null,\"RELATED_LIST\":null,\"SCORE\":\"0.7988201975822449\",\"URL_CATEGORY\":[{\"CATEGORY_ID\":\"305\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"EDITION_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"Lifestyle\",\"ALIAS\":\"lifestyle\",\"ARTICLE_COUNT\":\"272\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"PARENT\":\"215\",\"LEAF\":\"1\",\"DEFAULT_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"SPECIAL_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"HIDDEN_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_REGION\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR_ORDER\":\"0\"}],\"IMAGES\":[{\"ARTICLE_FIELD_ID\":\"66635\",\"FIELD_ID\":\"19\",\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"113664\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"FIELD_TITLE\":\"Category Image\",\"FIELD_TYPE\":\"THUMB\",\"FIELD_VALUE\":\"media\\/images\\/image_1470397909-62b3f05d66.jpg\",\"STATUS\":\"1\"}]},{\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"119296\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"CBL Wins Highest Number of Awards YetAgain at the SLIM Brand Excellence Awards\",\"SUBTITLE\":\"\",\"ALIAS\":\"CBL-Wins-Highest-Number-of-Awards-YetAgain-at-the-SLIM-Brand-Excellence-Awards\",\"INTRO_TEXT\":\"Ceylon Biscuits Limited (CBL) triumphed at the SLIM Brand Excellence Awards 2016, heldat the BMICH, on 08 November 2016, walking away with 8 awards in total,&nbsp;\\n\",\"FULL_TEXT\":\"<p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1479373037-f8499a06eb.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height:263px; width:600px\\\" \\/><span style=\\\"font-size:12px\\\"><strong>The Jubilant CBL Team<\\/strong><\\/span><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Ceylon Biscuits Limited (CBL) triumphed at the SLIM Brand Excellence Awards 2016, heldat the BMICH, on 08 November 2016, walking away with 8 awards in total, makingit the onlycompany to win a clutchas many as 8 awards at this year&rsquo;sceremony.

I&rsquo;m sure they wouldn&rsquo;t do that, because the population has been fed with this thing that the privatization is the bitter pill,&rdquo; he said.<br \\/>\\r\\nWickremaratne agreed, saying that the government cannot create effective, productive jobs, and it is the private sector which should be the employer.<br \\/>\\r\\nWijesinghe added that if independent regulatory bodies are performing their role, a market economy can be perpetuated with desirable regulation.<br \\/>\\r\\nThe comments were made during the &lsquo;Sri Lanka Towards 2020&rsquo;

Perera as the State Minister of Prisons and Rehabilitation, J. C. Alawathuwala as the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs and Harsha De Silva as the State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \\/>\\nSome changes in the portfolios of ministers of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party [SLFP] and the United People&rsquo;s Freedom Alliance [UPFA] are also to be made.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nAccording to our sister newspaper the Sunday Times, the more significant change is likely to be that of SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake from the agriculture ministry to the Ministry of Vocational Training and Skills Development. His place in the important agriculture ministry is likely to be given to UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Ameraweera who at one stage issued a statement that the SLFP-UPFA would not continue in the national government. But in a strange twist of political agendas he later announced in Parliament last week that the UNP-SLFP-UPFA coalition would continue.&nbsp;<br \\/>\\nAccording to reports, the changes came after prolonged discussion between President Maithripala Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe. Inside sources say that Premier Wickremesinghe had proposed that the former war-winning army commander Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka be appointed as the Minister of Law and Order but the President was not in favour of it. So provisionally Mr. Wickremesinghe will handle the law and order ministry.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nIn recent months, President Sirisena has been public critical of the law and order ministry largely because of what he saw as the delay in investigating and prosecuting cases of large scale corruption involving VIPs, officials and lackeys of the former Rajapaksa regime. During the campaign for the February 10 local elections where President Sirisena&rsquo;s SLFP faction was routed he had strongly declared that the battle against corruption would be his top priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \\/>\\nEarlier this month, the government introduced a draft bill to appoint at least three permanent three-Judge High Courts which would conduct high court-at-bar trials relating to major cases of corruption, bribery or other political crimes. Sittings would be held every morning and evening so that the cases could be concluded within months instead of years as they now do. Through this process, the government hopes to expedite the VIP corruption cases and there will also be provisions for easier way to recover the money plundered by VIPs or officials of the former regime.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nPolitical analysts say the only major change yesterday was somewhat of a demotion for senior minister and house leader Lakshman Kiriella who was moved from the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways to the Ministry of State Enterprise and Kandy Development. Minister Kiriella has been severely criticised for his role in the crisis involving the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and the controversy over the next phase of the Colombo Kandy highway.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br \\/>\\nWith the Cabinet changes, we hope the government - responding to the huge protest vote by the people at the local council elections - would take effective action to provide some short-term relief to the people while intensifying the battle against corrupt politicians or officials then and now and working honestly with integrity towards building a peaceful, just and all-inclusive society. In 2015, President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe rose above party politics and put the country first for their historic victory. We hope in the coming years, they would act as statesmen and not party politicians.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\",\"ADDED_DATE\":\"2018-02-26 00:46:05\",\"PUBLISH_DATE\":\"2018-02-26 00:43:42\",\"PUBLISH_END_DATE\":null,\"EVENT_DATE\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT1\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT2\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT3\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT4\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT5\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT6\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT7\":\"\",\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT8\":\"\",\"EXTERNAL_URL\":null,\"HITS\":\"8809\",\"COMMENTS\":\"2\",\"AUTHOR\":\"563\",\"AUTHOR_NAME\":\"Digital Media\",\"COMMENT_STATUS\":\"1\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"SPECIAL\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_LIST\":\"Opinion\",\"REGION\":null,\"REGION_NAME\":null,\"KEYWORDS_LIST\":null,\"METATAG_LIST\":null,\"RELATED_LIST\":null,\"SCORE\":\"0.7988201975822449\",\"URL_CATEGORY\":[{\"CATEGORY_ID\":\"172\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"EDITION_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"Opinion\",\"ALIAS\":\"opinion\",\"ARTICLE_COUNT\":\"9669\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"PARENT\":\"231\",\"LEAF\":\"1\",\"DEFAULT_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"SPECIAL_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"HIDDEN_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_REGION\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR_ORDER\":\"0\"}],\"IMAGES\":[{\"ARTICLE_FIELD_ID\":\"99402\",\"FIELD_ID\":\"19\",\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"146433\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"FIELD_TITLE\":\"Category Image\",\"FIELD_TYPE\":\"THUMB\",\"FIELD_VALUE\":\"media\\/images\\/image_1519617987-597d3e9ba1.jpg\",\"STATUS\":\"1\"}]},{\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"147457\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"CASE FOR A FACE BOOK  \\u2018SOCIAL MEDIA OMBUDSMAN\\u2019\",\"SUBTITLE\":\"\",\"ALIAS\":\"CASE-FOR-A-FACE-BOOK-SOCIAL-MEDIA-OMBUDSMAN-\",\"INTRO_TEXT\":\"Social media has been a medium of communication on computer mediated technology created to sharing information with individuals, clusters, and social groups, cheap, accessible and fast, until the ground breaking....\\n\",\"FULL_TEXT\":\"<h2><span style=\\\"color:#FF0000;\\\"><strong>Social Media - Modern Mediated Technology<\\/strong><\\/span><\\/h2>\\n\\n<p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1521401764-ceffc9357b.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 620px; height: 359px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Social media has been a medium of communication on computer mediated technology created to sharing information with individuals, clusters, and social groups, cheap, accessible and fast, until the ground breaking innovative introduction of Face Book by Mark Zuckerberg, a student of Israeli origin at Harvard, innovated for the students of the Harvard University that spread like wild fire all over the world due to innovations of the product.&nbsp;<img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1521401792-08a2d2f205.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px; height: 123px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; float: right;\\\" \\/><br \\/>\\nFacebook (Fb), is used by 3 billion people worldwide spread to 40% of the world population and 2 billion active monthly&nbsp; users.

The implementation of the Ombudsman scheme will be successful in Sri Lanka as educated professionals with sufficient teeth to deal with certain amount of powers by appointing educated and balanced personalities for the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \\/>\\nHate speeches and exchange of images and videos may have other underlying reasons and it is a good idea for the sociologist to find the root cause of its sudden eruption whether it is the resentment and disappointment of the citizen using this media to express their views.

To the same degree, there is also censure. After Rukmani Devi&rsquo;s death, for instance, that wave of hysteria did not preclude critics like Regi Siriwardena on passing judgment. Regi identified, correctly I believe, that Rukmani&rsquo;s overwhelming tragedy was the fact that her legacy was sealed by her reputation as a songstress of musical numbers which were &ldquo;not only third rate, but also second hand&rdquo;. While this would not have been palatable to her fans (and there were many of them, including my grandparents, who wept the day she died), it was the harsh truth. We saw the same kind of praise and censure greeting the deaths of Khemadasa (whose forays into opera were criticised as being elitist) and, closer to the Sinhala Buddhist homeland, Amaradeva (whose forays into the raghadari sampradaya and sarala geeya were assessed rather critically as well by various writers). Now that Lester James Peries has passed away, I thought it was an apt time to understand how icons, particularly from our cultural sphere, can divide opinion and sustain confusions when they pass away.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1525980100-ac20c77c91.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 620px; height: 414px;\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Lester James Peries<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;<br \\/>\\nDays after Lester&rsquo;s death, I happened to come across an article written by the inimitable Nalin de Silva, arguing, from what I could make of it, that the man effectively aborted the (at the outset Sinhala Buddhist) project of fusing tradition and modernity together, instead displacing tradition by a modernist cultural renaissance which depended for its enduring popularity the diffusion of certain Western paradigms. This is the kind of argument that was brought against Amaradeva and Sarachchandra, and also by de Silva. What NdeS (as I shall abbreviate him from here on wards) lays down is that the likes of Sarachchandra, Siri Gunasinghe and Lester James Peries brought about a cultural sphere which portrayed a false picture of our culture to our own people. This explains his preference for Piyadasa Sirisena over Martin Wickramasinghe.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/image_1525980129-e59ba5c647.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px; height: 133px; margin: 5px; float: right;\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nCriticism against Lester James Peries isn&rsquo;t the preserve of the Jathika Chinthanaya (JC) only, in fact no less a figure than Gunadasa Amarasekara in a review written in the eighties praised Lester&rsquo;s adaptation of Kaliyugaya, which to me is one of Wickramasinghe&rsquo;s novels which explicitly dwells on the kind of conflict between modernism and tradition that the JC is preoccupied with. Such disparate figures as Regi Siriwardena, Dr W. Dahanayake, H. L. D. Mahindapala, and Jayawilal Wilegoda did lambast him over certain works which were felt to be weakly plotted or structured, even if the criteria of values these writers based their criticisms on themselves didn&rsquo;t hold much water. But NdeS&rsquo; arguments against Lester are more philosophical than critical; they depend on the rhetoric of nationalism, not the rabble-rousing sort, but the virulently indigenous and majoritarian sort.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<h3><br \\/>\\nPraise and censure<\\/h3>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe truth is that Lester was perhaps the only director from here who has attracted praise and censure, sometimes by the same writers, from every corner of our critical fraternity: the Marxists, the feminists, and of course, the Sinhala Buddhist intellectuals from the JC.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nHere&rsquo;s an extract from NdeS&rsquo;s piece:&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\n\\u0d89\\u0d82\\u0d9c\\u0dd2\\u0dbb\\u0dd2\\u0dc3\\u0dd2 \\u0db4\\u0dcf\\u0dc3\\u0dbd\\u0dca\\u0dc0\\u0dbd \\u0d89\\u0d9c\\u0dd9\\u0db1 \\u0d9c\\u0dad\\u0dca \\u0d85\\u0dba \\u0db1\\u0dd6\\u0dad\\u0db1\\u0dad\\u0dca\\u0dc0\\u0dba \\u0db8\\u0dd4\\u0dc5\\u0dd4\\u0db8\\u0db1\\u0dd2\\u0db1\\u0dca \\u0db8 \\u0d85\\u0db1\\u0dd4\\u0d9a\\u0dbb\\u0dab\\u0dba \\u0d9a\\u0dc5\\u0dcf&rsquo; \\u0d91\\u0dc4\\u0dd9\\u0dad\\u0dca \\u0d92 \\u0d91\\u0d9a\\u0dca \\u0d85\\u0dba\\u0d9a\\u0dd4\\u0da7\\u0dc0\\u0dad\\u0dca \\u0d91\\u0dc4\\u0dd2 \\u0d89\\u0dc4\\u0dc5\\u0da7 \\u0db8 \\u0dba\\u0db1\\u0dca\\u0db1 \\u0db6\\u0dd0\\u0dbb\\u0dd2 \\u0dc0\\u0dd4\\u0dab\\u0dcf&rsquo; \\u0dbd\\u0dd9\\u0dc3\\u0dca\\u0da7\\u0dbb\\u0dca\\u0da7\\u0dad\\u0dca \\u0db6\\u0dd0\\u0dbb\\u0dd2 \\u0dc0\\u0dd4\\u0dab\\u0dcf&rsquo; \\u0db8\\u0d9c\\u0dda \\u0dc0\\u0dcf\\u0dc3\\u0db1\\u0dcf\\u0dc0\\u0d9a\\u0da7 \\u0db8\\u0da7 \\u0dc0\\u0dd0\\u0da9\\u0dd2\\u0d9a\\u0dbd\\u0dca \\u0dba\\u0db1\\u0dca\\u0db1 \\u0d89\\u0dc3\\u0dca\\u0dc3\\u0dbb \\u0dad\\u0dda\\u0dbb\\u0dd4\\u0db8\\u0dca \\u0d9c\\u0dd2\\u0dba\\u0dcf \\u0db6\\u0da7\\u0dc4\\u0dd2\\u0dbb \\u0dc0\\u0dd2\\u0daf\\u0dca\\u0dba\\u0dcf\\u0da7\\u0da5\\u0dba\\u0d9a\\u0dd4 \\u0dc0\\u0dd3\\u0db8\\u0da7 \\u0db6\\u0dd0\\u0dbb\\u0dd2 \\u0db6\\u0dc0&rsquo; \\u0d89\\u0d82\\u0d9c\\u0dd2\\u0dbb\\u0dd2\\u0dc3\\u0dd2\\u0db1\\u0dca \\u0d85\\u0dbb \\u0dc3\\u0dca\\u0dc0\\u0db7\\u0dcf\\u0dc2\\u0dcf \\u0db4\\u0dcf\\u0dc3\\u0dbd\\u0dca\\u0dc0\\u0dbd \\u0d89\\u0d9c\\u0dd9\\u0db1 \\u0d9c\\u0dad\\u0dca \\u0d85\\u0dba\\u0da7\\u0dad\\u0dca \\u0db1\\u0dd6\\u0dad\\u0db1\\u0dad\\u0dca\\u0dc0\\u0dba \\u0d85\\u0db1\\u0dd4\\u0d9a\\u0dbb\\u0dab\\u0dba \\u0d9a\\u0dbb\\u0db1\\u0dca\\u0db1 \\u0d89\\u0d9c\\u0dd0\\u0db1\\u0dca\\u0db1\\u0dd4\\u0dc0\\u0dcf&rsquo; \\u0dc3\\u0dd2\\u0d82\\u0dc4\\u0dbd \\u0d9c\\u0dd4\\u0dbb\\u0dd4\\u0dc0\\u0dbb\\u0dd4&rdquo; \\u0dc0\\u0dd9\\u0daf\\u0db8\\u0dc4\\u0dad\\u0dca\\u0dc0\\u0dbb\\u0dd4&rdquo; \\u0db1\\u0ddc\\u0dad\\u0dcf\\u0dbb\\u0dd2\\u0dc3\\u0dca \\u0dbb\\u0dcf\\u0dc5\\u0dc4\\u0dcf\\u0db8\\u0dd2\\u0dbd\\u0dcf&rdquo; \\u0d9c\\u0db8\\u0dca\\u0db8\\u0dd4\\u0dbd\\u0dcf\\u0daf\\u0dd1\\u0db1\\u0dd2\\u0dc0\\u0dbb\\u0dd4 \\u0d86\\u0daf\\u0dd3\\u0db1\\u0dca \\u0db6\\u0dd2\\u0dc4\\u0dd2\\u0dc0\\u0dd4\\u0dab\\u0dda \\u0db8\\u0dda \\u0db4\\u0dcf\\u0dc3\\u0dbd\\u0dca\\u0dc0\\u0dbd\\u0dd2\\u0db1\\u0dca&rsquo; .<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;<br \\/>\\nThe allegation, of course, is that even though Lester imitated and in some ways mastered the sort of cultural modernity which was dependent on Westernisation, and that through the cinema, he was unable (as were Martin Wickramasinghe and other artistes, thinkers, and scientists) to transcend his own identity and win over the country. In other words, he was a modernist, but without the anchorage to his country that was needed if he was to transcend the limits of his roots and become an artistes of his nation. I leave the contentious debate this necessitates for a later week, since I&rsquo;m quite unaware of the dynamics that go into the making and resolution of such debates, but for the moment I am concerned with NdeS&rsquo;s central claim: that the lack of Sinhala-ness in Lester&rsquo;s movies proves the cultural experiment in 1956 did not bring popular audiences to the purveyors of that experiment. Piyadasa Sirisena, long before Martin Wickramasinghe, could do that. So could Sirisena Wimalaweera, the playwright and the filmmaker. But not Lester and Amaradeva.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<h3><br \\/>\\nOpinion of Sinhala journalists&nbsp;<\\/h3>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nThe fact is that while NdeS was making this claim from one side of the political spectrum (which applies, by the way, to the cultural, just as it does to the political), from the other side another intellectual was making the opposite claim. Consider the following:&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nMany Sinhala journalists have praised and even said that the late Dr Lester James Peries [is] the greatest cinema maker in Sri Lanka, and surely one of the best in the world... I stand to disagree with those claims. Lester was a great cine narrator no doubt. Yet his cinema use was essentially an urban middle class anxiety that soothed the postcolonial Sinhala nationalist insecurity. Like Pundit Amaradeva, Lester never could be considered as a transformative social artist who provided a trajectory for a deconstructive social mobility. But [he] rather reconfirmed the hegemony of the state-centric (in fact Sinhala urban) ideology in almost all his work. My complaint is not because he made something like Rekava but [because] he refused to move from that neo-colonial &ldquo;Sarala Rekava.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>The allegation, of course, is that even though Lester imitated and in some ways mastered the sort of cultural modernity which was dependent on Westernisation, and that through the cinema, he was unable to transcend his own identity and win over the country<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<\\/blockquote>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nHere&rsquo;s the deal; when NdeS and the so-called &ldquo;intellectual protectionists&rdquo; of the JC claim that Amaradeva and Lester et al were not Sinhalese and Buddhist enough to transcend their universality, the likes of the writer of this comment, posted on Facebook hours after Lester&rsquo;s death, contend that far from being uprooted from that Sinhalese Buddhist culture, these artists actually strengthened the worldview of that particular milieu, and in doing so strengthened the cultural and political hegemony present therein at the cost of the Other.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nNow which side are we to believe? The side that says the revolutionists were renegades, or the side that says the renegades were revolutionists? Did Lester and Amaradeva go back on their mission to bring Sri Lanka together through the arts, or were they removed from the heartbeat of the people, I for one can&rsquo;t tell, but in the philosophical conundrum this compels, I can sense irony and some humour too. And in the end, I suppose that has a lot to do with how we view things; the problem at the heart of the leading preachers of the JC has been their inability to bridge their praise for cultural relativism over their inability to view the world through the prism of that kind of relativism. They hold certain facts sacred, objective, and when they talk about the world in those terms, they believe that the world cannot be talked about in any other terms. How else would someone like Lester, Amaradeva and Wickramasinghe, who had their faults and flaws, be at the receiving end of their vitriol the moment the critics of the JC allege that these artists perpetuated the political and cultural hegemonies which were propped up and supported by the JC?&nbsp; &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><br \\/>\\nPerhaps it&rsquo;s time we took a breather and looked back. Somewhere out there, Peries and the revolutionists of 1956 are laughing. At us. And at those who are muddling up their notions of hegemonies and traditions in a bid to lambast those artists.<\\/p>\\n\",\"ADDED_DATE\":\"2018-05-11 00:53:00\",\"PUBLISH_DATE\":\"2018-05-11 00:42:47\",\"PUBLISH_END_DATE\":null,\"EVENT_DATE\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT1\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT2\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT3\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT4\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT5\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT6\":null,\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT7\":\"\",\"THUMB_IMAGE_OPT8\":\"\",\"EXTERNAL_URL\":null,\"HITS\":\"794\",\"COMMENTS\":\"0\",\"AUTHOR\":\"567\",\"AUTHOR_NAME\":\"Opinion\",\"COMMENT_STATUS\":\"1\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"SPECIAL\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_LIST\":\"News Features\",\"REGION\":null,\"REGION_NAME\":null,\"KEYWORDS_LIST\":null,\"METATAG_LIST\":null,\"RELATED_LIST\":null,\"SCORE\":\"0.7988201975822449\",\"URL_CATEGORY\":[{\"CATEGORY_ID\":\"131\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"EDITION_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"News Features\",\"ALIAS\":\"news-features\",\"ARTICLE_COUNT\":\"2813\",\"STATUS\":\"1\",\"PARENT\":null,\"LEAF\":\"1\",\"DEFAULT_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"SPECIAL_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"HIDDEN_CATEGORY\":\"0\",\"CATEGORY_REGION\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR\":\"0\",\"TITLE_BAR_ORDER\":\"0\"}],\"IMAGES\":[{\"ARTICLE_FIELD_ID\":\"102730\",\"FIELD_ID\":\"19\",\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"149761\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"FIELD_TITLE\":\"Category Image\",\"FIELD_TYPE\":\"THUMB\",\"FIELD_VALUE\":\"media\\/images\\/image_1525980084-ca5010c90d.jpg\",\"STATUS\":\"1\"}]},{\"ARTICLE_ID\":\"84737\",\"SITE_ID\":\"1\",\"TITLE\":\"M Power Capital celebrates one year in business\",\"SUBTITLE\":\"\",\"ALIAS\":\"m-power-capital-celebrates-one-year-in-business\",\"INTRO_TEXT\":\"?M Power Capital Limited (MPC), the Colombo-based corporate finance advisory and private equity group, is celebrating its first anniversary. &nbsp;&nbsp;\\r\\n\",\"FULL_TEXT\":\"\\r\\n<img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/static.dailymirror.lk\\/media\\/images\\/Anil-Cooray-Chairman-M-Power-Capital.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 200px; height: 266px; float: right; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 10px;\\\" \\/>M Power Capital Limited (MPC), the Colombo-based corporate finance advisory and private equity group, is celebrating its first anniversary. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nLocated at Horton Place, M Power Capital was established by a group of experienced industry experts with operational specialisation in diverse fields.&nbsp;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nThe team&rsquo;s primary areas of specialisation include Banking and Investment Banking, Risk Management, Property Development, Civil Engineering and Construction, Telecommunications, Apparel Manufacturing, Gem and Lapidary Trade, Manufacturing and Retail Merchandising. The Company&rsquo;s client portfolio ranges from Large and Medium sized corporates (including financial institutions and multinationals) to SMEs and HNW Investors. M Power&rsquo;s key strengths are preparing client companies for disposal and then executing the transaction, advising buy-side investors (corporate and individual) on a potential acquisition until execution, corporate restructuring, project finance and arranging funding. MPC is also geared to manage IPOs and Private Placements.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nSpeaking on the creation of MPC, Chairman Anil Cooray stated, &ldquo;Financial markets in Sri Lanka have experienced unprecedented change over the past few years, particularly after the ending of the long civil war in 2009. This has created a number of new challenges for corporates across different industries.&rdquo; He added that recent developments in capital markets, volatility in equity markets and the government&rsquo;s development initiatives have created new avenues for foreign investment and a renewed focus on capital market activity, changing the financial landscape for business. &nbsp;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n&nbsp;Cooray further stated that, &ldquo;With access to experienced and qualified foreign professional partners, our team of investment bankers are fully geared to simplify what would normally appear to be a very complex or time-consuming transaction. We have the connections in the local market to get over various challenges and one overriding quality of our work is being completely open and transparent with our clients. In addition to this, we recognise that this is a small market and we really have to ensure strict confidentiality at all times, balancing this with a robust compliance structure.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nRecalling the first year in operation, which Cooray termed an eventful year for the Company, he said &ldquo;Using our broad experience across many industries, we were able to lay a solid foundation for future growth while also being actively involved in a few significant deals.&rdquo; One of the key highlights was when Sarasavi Exports (Pvt) Limited, a supplier to major high street retailers in the United Kingdom, approached MPC for financial and transactional &nbsp;advice on the acquisition of Isabella (Pvt) Limited , a subsidiary of the DB Apparel Group, the &nbsp;market leader in branded intimate apparel and hosiery in Europe.&nbsp;<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n&ldquo;The Sarasavi-Isabella deal was indeed a good indicator of how much confidence clients were ready to place in us, taking into consideration our team&rsquo;s collective experience,&rdquo; he said. MPC managed the end to end transaction process including conducting the negotiations with Sun Capital Partners, one of the largest private equity firms in Europe and the parent company of the DB Apparel Group. This also allowed Sun Capital Partners to dispose of their stake in DB Apparel to Hanes Brands, which is a hosiery giant incorporated in the USA. MPC continues to provide finance advisory services, post-acquisition, to Isabella (Pvt) Limited.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\n&ldquo;The future looks bright indeed, as the policies of the new government gives direction and strongly supports economic stability,&rdquo; stated Cooray, adding, &ldquo;MPC looks forward to working with companies in Sri Lanka and Asia, focussing on creating optimum capital structures and ensuring sustainable revenue streams &ndash; always with a long term relationship in mind.&rdquo;\",\"ADDED_DATE\":\"2015-08-25 03:04:57\",\"PUBLISH_DATE\":\"2015-08-25
